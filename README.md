firstly i've created  a new repo with a new branch
with to files accounting.html and index.html
in java script file i've created objects for each employee and i've used a method to generate a unique id number
and i've created a netgod to calculate the salary for each employee and the net salary finally i render the information from java script to the website.
 i will creat a new branch and now i will make a construactor and use it instead of creating object for each employee.
 i will create a new branch and i will make a card for each employee usinf DOM manipulation
